# Classification framework - wishlist

There are two types of wishlist - one that 
### config_param.py
- some more parameters could be defined in the confiq to make it more dynamic

### directoryPath.py
- To be updated with outpath, etc.

### reading_data.py
- Can be improved with reading in chunk size

### eda.py
- Histogram can be improved with more customization and  outlier, varible importance plots need to be included. Can add some other plots which better help explain the data.
- Correlation plot needs to be improved

### data_prep.py
- The create label feature function should be dynamic to take the dependent variable input and needs to be improved
- Data type casting needs to be improved
- Need to explore more on outlier treatment.
- Multi processing needs to be included

### Feature_transformation.py

- Binning, Parameter Interaction need to be included

### feature_selection.py
- Need to improve process of doing Feature Selection

### modelData_split 


###  plot_residual
- More plots can be included to understand the predictions better

###  lime_ModelExplainer  
- deciding optimal number of features to be explained. 


###  log_outputs 


###  evaluation_metric.py
- More evaluation technique can be added

###  StatisticalModels 
- More methods of Multi processing needs to be included
- Need make grid search functions precise
- Randomized search needs to be included

###  MLModels 
- More methods of Multi processing needs to be included
- Need make grid search functions precise
- Randomized search needs to be included
- More ensemble methods

###  H2OModels.py
- More algorithms can be included

### DLModels.py      
- More algorithms can be included

###  main file

- It should input the train data from one timeline and have the validation and test data from the other timeline

## 2. Resource Server
- GPU machines for neural network algorithms 
- What-if-tool -- dashboard kind of 
- Tensor Board can be implemented
- Git Plugin in Jupyter notebook
